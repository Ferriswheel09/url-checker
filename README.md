# url-checker
A simple project for checking the validity of URLs. 

## Why am I making this
1. Mostly to refamiliarize myself with React (first time using Vite, not the first time using React)
2. Easier tool for checking the validity of URLs (when I don't have access to Bitdefender, which is my security tool)

## Getting Started
More to come, but as of now, going into both directories, then executing the following:
```
npm install 
npm run dev
```
will suffice.
